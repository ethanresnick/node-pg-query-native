# 0 build on mac first

build the binary on mac 

# 1 build the docker image

run `docker-compose build`

# 2 start the server

```sh
docker run -d \
  -it \
  --name build_pg_query \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/libpg_query,target=/pg_query \
  pyramation/libpg_query
```

# 3 jump inside

`ssh` into the box

```sh
docker exec -it build_pg_query /bin/bash
```

# publishing from inside 

```sh
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/pyramation/pg-plpgsql-query-native
cd pg-plpgsql-query-native/
yarn

# get the OSX version you build before...
cp /pg_query/osx/libpg_query.a ./libpg_query/osx/

# add your creds real quick... (look in your ~/.npmrc)
vi .npmrc
vi package.json
npm publish
```

# building libpg_query

not necessary, but for fun:

```sh
mkdir git
cd git/
git clone git clone git@github.com:lfittl/libpg_query.git
git clone git@github.com:lfittl/libpg_query.git
git clone https://github.com/lfittl/libpg_query.git
cd libpg_query/
make
cp libpg_query.a /pg_query/linux/
```
 
you should see `.a` files now :)

```
libpg_query/
libpg_query//osx
libpg_query//osx/libpg_query.a
libpg_query//osx/.gitkeep
libpg_query//include
libpg_query//include/.gitkeep
libpg_query//include/pg_query.h
libpg_query//linux
libpg_query//linux/libpg_query.a
libpg_query//linux/.gitkeep
libpg_query//windows
libpg_query//windows/.gitkeep
```

make sure you grab the `pg_query.h` if you don't have it ;)
